## Course Content Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  

* Translate a research question into an appropriate statistical analysis plan. 
* Prepare data for analysis by cleaning and transforming raw data. 
* Perform research in a reproducible manner. 
* Build a multivariate statistical model used to examine a real process. 
* Report the results of the analysis in plain language to a consulting client or collaborator. 

## Topics Covered

* Data cleaning
* Multiple linear regression
* Model building: Variable selection
* Dimension Reduction: Principle components and Factor Analysis
* Logistic regression

## Structure of this class
- Quasi flipped classroom. 
- Students read the book, review lecture notes and work on practice coding
  prior to class. 
- Class time is devoted to reviewing the material, answering questions, 
  working examples, discussing interpretations and limitations of methods 
  learned.
- Mondays will have either a quiz or homework submission. 
- Expect to bring your laptop every day to class.
