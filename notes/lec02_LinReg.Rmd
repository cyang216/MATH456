# Simple Regression and Correlation (_Afifi Ch 6_)

## Aims
* Describe the relationship between an independent variable X and a continuous
  dependent variable $Y$ as a straight line. The textbook discusses two cases: 
    - Fixed-$X$: values of $X$ are preselected by investigator
    - Variable-$X$: have random sample of $(X,Y)$ values
    - Calculations are the same, 
* Draw inferences regarding this relationship
* Predict value of $Y$ for a given value of $X$

## Mathmatical Model
* The mean of $Y$ values at any given $X$ is $\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X$
* The variance of $Y$ values at any $X$ is $\sigma^2$ (same for all X)
* $Y$ values are normally distributed at any given $X$ (need for inference)

## Parameter Estimates
* Estimate the slope $\beta_{1}$ and intercept $\beta_{0}$ using least-squares methods.
* The residual mean squared error (RMSE) is an estimate of the variance $s^{2}$
* Typically interested in inference on $\beta_{1}$
    - Assume no relationship between $X$ and $Y$ $(H_{0}: \beta_{1}=0)$ 
      until there is reason to believe there is one 
      $(H_{0}: \beta_{1} \neq 0)$

## Interval estimation
* Everything is estimated with some degree of error
* Confidence intervals for the mean of $Y$
* Prediction intervals for an individual $Y$ 

Which one is wider? Why?

## Corelation Coefficient
* The correlation coefficient $\rho$ measures the strength of association
  between $X$ and $Y$ in the _population_.
* $\sigma^{2} = VAR(Y|X)$ is the variance of $Y$ for a specific $X$.
* $\sigma_{y}^{2} = VAR(Y)$ is the variance of $Y$ for all $X$'s.

$$ \sigma^{2} = \sigma_{y}^{2}(1-\rho^{2})$$
$$ \rho^{2} = \frac{\sigma_{y}^{2} - \sigma^{2}}{\sigma_{y}^{2}}$$

* $\rho^{2}$ = reduction in variance of Y associated with knowledge of X/original variance of Y
* **Coefficient of Determiniation**: $100\rho^{2}$ = % of variance of Y “associated with X” or “explained by X”
* Caution: association vs. causation.

### Example: Lung Function
Data were from an epidemiological study of households living in four areas with
different amounts and types of air pollution.



We use only the data taken on the fathers, all are nonsmokers:
X = height in inches
Y = forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
