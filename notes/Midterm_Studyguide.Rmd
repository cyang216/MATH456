## Things to look out for with Regression
1. Multicolinearity
2. Outliers
3. Poor model fit
4. Violation of assumptions

## Model assumptions
1. Linearity between $Y$ and $X$.
2. Residuals: $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2})$

## Outliers
1. Measures of influence
    a. DFFITS
    b. Leverage
    c. Cooks Distance
    d. Studentized residuals
2. Identifying outliers
    a. Residual plots
    b. Determining outliers in Y
    c. Determining outliers in X
    d. Determining influential points
    
    
## Variable selection procedures
1. Pro's and cons for each method
    a. Forward/Backward/Stepwise selections
    b. Stepwise selection
    c. Manual selection
2. Measures of fit
    a. Information criteria: AIC/BIC
    b. R-squared
    c. Cross-validation error
