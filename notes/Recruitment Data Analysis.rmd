# Purpose
The Execitive recruitment industry is in the business of getting people jobs, and filling open positions. Individuals who are recruited already are employed, the recruiters attempt to get the person to leave their job (possibly move across country) for a new job. The individuals in each office are basically head hunting people to pull from one company to another. 

# Project Introduction

Dr. Jim Downing from the College of Business at CSU, Chico provided us with a recruitment database and posed some research questions. The recruitment data set is a collection of multi-level self-reported data regarding the Executive recruitment industry. 

There is data on 456 firms under this franchise umbrella. The data is collected by the franchise on the individuals within the firm, and the transactions that firm makes. A franchise - you are the owner/operator of your office. you pay the franchise $ to use their name/marketing etc. These offices compete with each other, sometimes they collaborate. Employees working in the office are like independent contractors themselves - working for commissions only. The firm pays them by contract.


## Phase 1: Data Exploration
Each group chose one or two research questions posed by Dr. Downing to explore. The variables were examined univariately, missing data was examined and potential transformations were considered. A draft exploratory data analysis was submitted and reviewed by your course instructor, Dr. Donatello. A final draft was submitted to Dr. Downing, and the results of the exploratory data analysis was presented to him during an in-person meeting. No statistical tests were run at this point. 


## Phase 2: Analysis & Model building
Formally test the posed hypothesis for the bivariate relationship explored in part I. Start model building

# Peer Feedback

You are asked to write constructive comments, suggestions for edits, and/or general feedback
regarding the report or the presentation.
