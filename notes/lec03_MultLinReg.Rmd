# Assigned Reading
Afifi: Chapter 7

# Multiple Regression and Correlation (_Afifi Ch 7_)

## Aims
* Extend simple linear regression.
* Describe linear relationship between a single continuous $Y$ variable, 
  and several $X$ variables.
* Draw inferences regarding this relationship.
* Predict $Y$ from $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots , X_{P}$.

Now it's no longer a 2D regression _line_, but a $p$ dimensional 
regression plane. 

![Figure 7.1](regression_plane.png)

## Types of X variables
* Fixed: The levels of $X$ are selected in advance with the intent to measure
  the affect on an outcome $Y$. 
* Variable: Random sample of individuals from the population is taken and $X$
  and $Y$ are measured on each individual. 
* X's can be continuous or discrete (categorical)
* X's can be transformations of other X's, e.g., polynomial regression

## Mathematical Model
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

* Mean of $y$ values at any given $x_{i}$ is: $E(y|x_{i}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{p}$
* Variance of $Y$ values at any set of values of $X$'s is $\sigma^2$ (same
  for all X's)
* $Y$ values are normally distributed at any given $X$ (need for inference)


The regression model relates $y$ to a function of $\textbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{\beta}$, 
where $\textbf{X}$ is a $nxp$ matrix of $p$ covariates on $n$ observations and 
$\mathbf{\beta}$ is a length $p$ vector of regression coefficients. 

$$ \textbf{y} = \textbf{X} \mathbf{\beta} + \mathbf{\epsilon} $$

### Estimation of parameters
The goal of regression analysis is to minimize the residual error. 
That is, to minimize the difference between the value of the dependent
variable predicted by the model and the true value of the dependent variable.

$$ \epsilon_{i} = \hat{y_{i}} - y_{i}$$

The method of least squares accomplishes this by finding parameter estimates 
$\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ that minimized the sum of the squared residuals:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_{i} $$

For simple linear regression these are found to be 
$$ \hat{\beta_{0}} = \bar{y} * \hat{\beta_{1}}\bar{x} \quad \mbox{  and  } \quad  \hat{\beta_{1}} = r\frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}} $$

For multiple linear regression the function to minimize is

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_{i} - \sum_{i=1}^{p}X_{ij}\beta_{j}|^{2}$$

Or in matrix notation

$$ || \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta} ||^{2} $$ 

The details of methods to solve these minimization functions are left to a
course in mathematical statistics, however we will return to this notation. 

### Continued Example: Lung Function
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

In Chapter 6 the data for fathers from the lung function data set were 
analyzed. These data fit the variable-X case. Height was used as the 
$X$ variable in order to predict `FEV`. 

```{r}
fev <- read.delim("C:/GitHub/MATH456/data/Lung_020716.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
summary(lm(FFEV1 ~ FHEIGHT , data=fev))
round(confint(lm(FFEV1 ~ FHEIGHT , data=fev)),2)
```
This model concludes that FEV1 in fathers significantly increases by 0.12 (95% CI:
0.09, 0.15) liters per additional inch in height (p<.0001). Looking at the 
multiple $R^{2}$ (correlation of determination), this simple model explains 
25% of the variance seen in the outcome $y$. 

However, FEV tends to decrease with age for adults, so we should be able
to predict it better if we use both height and age as independent variables
in a multiple regression equation. 

First let's see different ways to graphically explore the relationship between
three characteristics simultaneously.

#### 3D scatterplots
```{r}
library(scatterplot3d)
scatterplot3d(x=fev$FHEIGHT, y=fev$FAGE, z=fev$FFEV1, 
              xlab="Height", ylab="Age", zlab="FEV", 
              main="Relationship between FEV1, height and age for fathers.")
```

See http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/scatterplot.html for two simple ways to
create interactive, spinning 3D scatterplots. 

#### Controlling the color, or size of points using the third characteristic
```{r, fig.width=10}
library(gridExtra)
a <- qplot(y=FFEV1, x=FAGE, color=FHEIGHT, data=fev)
b <- qplot(y=FFEV1, x=FHEIGHT, size=FAGE, data=fev)
grid.arrange(a, b, ncol=2)
```

The scatterplot of FEV against age demonstrates the decreasing trend of
FEV as age increases, and the increasing trend of FEV as height increases. 
The third color however is pretty scattered across the plot. There is no
obvious trend observed.

*  What direction do you expect the slope coefficient for age to be? For height? 

## Model fitting
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

Fitting a regression model in R with more than 1 predictor is trivial. Just add
each variable to the right hand side of the model notation connected with a `+`. 

```{r}
mv_model <- lm(FFEV1 ~ FAGE + FHEIGHT, data=fev)
summary(mv_model)
```
Both height and age are significantly associated with FEV in fathers (p<.0001 each).

### ANOVA for regression
For a global test to see whether or not the regression model is helpful in 
predicting the values of $y$, we can use an ANOVA. This is the same as testing
that all $\beta_{j}, j=1, \ldots, p$ are all equal to 0. Let's look at what
we get if we wrap the ANOVA function, `aov()` around the linear model results. 

```{r}
summary(aov(mv_model))
```

We get the sums of squares (SS) for each predictor individually, not combined
into a SS for regression and a SS residuals. So where do we find this
global test that this model is better than using no predictors at all? 
At the very last line in the summary of the linear model results. 

```{r}
summary(mv_model)
```

## Predictions
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

What is the predicted FEV1 for a 30-year-old male whose height was 70 inches?
There are multiple ways to evaluate this calculation. 

1. Manual calculation by plugging in the value of each variable individually
```{r}
betas <- mv_model$coefficients
betas
betas[1] + betas[2]*30 + betas[3]*70
```

_Interpretation:_ We would expect a a 30-year-old male whose height was 70
inches to have an FEV1 value of 4.45 liters.

2. In matrix notation a new vector `x.new` is created and multiplied
by the vector of coefficients. 
```{r}
x.new <- c(1, 30, 70)
x.new %*% betas
```

3. Using the `predict()` function. This requires the `newdat` input to be a
a `data.frame` object. 
```{r}
x.pred <- data.frame(cbind(FAGE = 30, FHEIGHT = 70))
predict(mv_model, newdata=x.pred)
```

Compare this value to the single predictor equation with just height:
```{r}
slr.mod <- lm(FFEV1 ~ FHEIGHT, data=fev)
predict(slr.mod, newdata = data.frame(FHEIGHT=70))
```

## Interpretation of regression coefficients
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

This value of `r round(predict(slr.mod, newdata = data.frame(FHEIGHT=70)),2) `
is the rate of change of FEV1 for fathers as a function of height when no other
variables are taken into account. For the model that includes age, the 
coefficient for  height is now `r round(mv_model$coefficients[3],2)`, which is
interpreted as the rate of change of FEV1 as a function of height **after adjusting
for age**. This is also called the **partial regression coefficient** of FEV1 on 
height after adjusting for age. 

* Problem: Values of $\hat{\beta_{j}}$’s are NOT directly comparable for any $j=1, \ldots, p$. 
* Solution: Standardized coefficients:
$$\hat{\beta}_{j} = \hat{\beta}_{j} \frac{s_{x_{j}}}{s_{y}}$$
* These coefficients are the same as if you standardized the data X and
  Y prior to conducting the regression. 
* The larger the magnitude of the standardized coefficient, 
  the more $X_{i}$ directly contributes to the prediction of $y$. 
* The standardized slope coefficient is the amount of change in the mean of
  the standardized $y$ values when the value of $X$ is increased by one
  standard deviation, keeping the other $X$ variables constant. 


### Interlude: Reporting regression coefficients using tables in Markdown
There are not many options for making readable tables in Markdown.
For better control you would be best suited by switching to LaTeX and
Sweave (both can be done in R Studio). Here is a reference webpage
that shows three basic options. 
http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/pages/figs_tables.html 

Here is an example using `xtable`. 
I first ruond the results of the table to 2 digits, then format the
p-value to read <.0001 instead of a super small digit. Then I wrap
`xtable()` around that output. 
```{r, results="asis"}
library(xtable)
coeff.out <- round(summary(mv_model)$coef, 2)
coeff.out[,4] <- ifelse(coeff.out[,4]<.0001, "<.0001", coeff.out[,4])
tab <- xtable(coeff.out)
names(tab)[3:4] <- c("t", "p-value")
print(tab, type="html")
```

_R specifics_:  Rounding has to come first because the `ifelse()` changed the 
data type in the entire matrix from numeric to character, and once it's a 
character you can't round. There are ways around this but I am not going
to discuss it here. 


## Other parameters estimated
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

For the variable-X case, several additional parameters are needed to characterize
the full joint distribution $f(x, y)$. A matrix of the estimated covariances 
between the parameter estimates $\beta{j}$'s can be obtained in R by using the `vcov()` 
function on the model output. 

```{r}
round(vcov(mv_model), digits=3)
```

**Note:** This is NOT the same as the variance-covariance matrix of the actual
data. This can be found using the variance `var()` function. For the sake of 
example I put a third covariate in the list: `FWEIGHT`. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
x.vars <- fev %>% select(FAGE, FHEIGHT, FWEIGHT, FFEV1) # requires dplyr
round(var(x.vars), digits=3)
```

* The variances $\sigma^{2}_{1}, \sigma^{2}_{2}, \ldots, \sigma^{2}_{p}$ are
  found down the diagonal.
* The covariances $\sigma_{ij}$ are found on the off diagonal entries.  
* This matrix is symmetric

Similarly the correlation matrix can be found using the `cor()` function.
```{r}
round(cor(x.vars), digits=3)
```

* The correlation of a variable with itself is always 1, hence the 1's down the
  diagonal.
* Each entry on the off diagonal is the simple correlation value: $\rho_{12}$. 
* This matrix is also symmetric. 




## Regression diagnostics and transformations
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

The same set of regression diagnostics can be examined to identify
any potential influential points, outliers or other problems with
the linear model. 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(mv_model)
```

The textbook provides more details about tools to detect 
outliers and influential points by examining the following
measures:

* studentized residuals
* leverage
* DFFITS
* Cooks distance

At least one reference website on how to visualize these 
measures can be found here: 
http://www.statmethods.net/stats/rdiagnostics.html


### Multicollinearity

* Occurs when some of the X variables are highly intercorrelated.
* Affects estimates and their SE’s (p. 143)
* Look at tolerance, and its inverse, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
* Need tolerance < 0.01, or VIF > 100.

```{r}
library(car)
vif(mv_model)
tolerance = 1/vif(mv_model)
tolerance
```

* Solution: use variable selection to delete some X variables.
* Alternatively, use Principal Components (Ch. 14)

## Interactions between variables
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

Consider a model with only two predictors: $X_{i}$ and $x_{j}$.

$$E(y|x_{i}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2} $$

A model of this form is said to be_additive_

If the additive terms for these variables do not completely specify their
effects on the dependent variable &


For demonstration purposes, consider the situation where the data came to us
as _long_ format with a separate variable for gender instead of in _wide_
format with separate variables for mother and father characteristics. 
Here I combine height, FEV and age for both males and females into a single 
long data set. 
```{r}
fev2 <- data.frame(gender = c(fev$FSEX, fev$MSEX), 
                   FEV = c(fev$FFEV1, fev$MFEV1), 
                   ht = c(fev$FHEIGHT, fev$MHEIGHT), 
                   age = c(fev$FAGE, fev$MAGE))
fev2$gender <- factor(fev2$gender, labels=c("M", "F"))
head(fev2)  
```

What does the relationship between height and FEV look like for the overall
sample? 
```{r}
ggplot(data=fev2, aes(x=ht, y=FEV)) + geom_point() + xlab("Height") + 
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of FEV vs height of adults") + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method='lm', col="purple")
```

However if we examine the relationship separately by gender we see
a slightly different story. 
```{r}
ggplot(data=fev2, aes(x=ht, y=FEV, col=gender)) + geom_point() + xlab("Height") + 
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of FEV vs height of adults by gender") + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method='lm') + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x=ht, y=FEV), col="purple", se=FALSE, method='lm')
```

If we put numeric summaries to these bivariate relationships we see that the
correlation between FEV and height overall is
`cor(fev2$FEV, fev2$ht)` = `r round(cor(fev2$FEV, fev2$ht),2)`, but for
males it is
`cor(fev$FFEV, fev$FHEIGHT)` = `r round(cor(fev$FFEV, fev$FHEIGHT),2)`, 
and for females the correlation is
`cor(fev$MFEV, fev$MHEIGHT)` = `r round(cor(fev$MFEV, fev$MHEIGHT),2)`.


**Conclusion:** The relationship between FEV1 and height depends on gender. 
These variables are said to **interact** with each other. 

### Recap of a main effects model
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

First let's examine the _main effects_ model, that is the model without any
interaction terms. 

$$ FEV1 \sim \beta_{0} +  \beta_{1}*height + \beta_{2}*gender$$


```{r}
summary(lm(FEV ~ ht + gender, data=fev2))
```
The first thing to notice is the coefficient label: `genderF`. The gender 
variable is a factor variable, and is automatically _dummy coded_ into a 
new variable that is not present on the data set but only as part of the 
linear model function. This variable `genderF` is a 1 if the gender on record 
is female, and 0 otherwise. In this case there is only one other option, Male, 
so when `genderF=0` the record states male.

#### Interpretations
* For every inch taller someone is, their FEV increases by 0.1 liters. 
* Females have a FEV measurement of 0.57 lower compared to males of the same height. 

### Adding interaction terms to a model
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

The full interaction model can be written as: 
$$ FEV1 \sim \beta_{0} +  \beta_{1}*height + \beta_{2}*gender + \beta_{3}*ht*gender $$

To add an interaction term to a linear model in R you use the `*` operator between
the interaction variables.

```{r}
intx_model <- lm(FEV ~ ht + gender + ht*gender, data=fev2)
summary(intx_model)
confint(intx_model)
```

The p-value for the interaction term `ht:genderF` is large, and the confidence
interval for this parameter covers zero, so there is no indication that an 
interaction exists. That is, there is not enough reason to believe that gender
significantly affects the relationship between height and FEV. 

**Reminder** Just as in a Two-Way ANOVA with an interaction term, the main effects
cannot be interpreted directly when there is an interaction in the model. 


## Stratification
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

A model where there exists a variable that interacts with all other variables
in the model can be considered a stratification variable. 

Example: Within each gender there exists a negative correlation between age
and FEV. However in the combined sample this appears to be a positive correlation. 

```{r}
ggplot(data=fev2, aes(x=ht, y=age, col=gender)) + geom_point() + xlab("Age") + 
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of FEV vs age of adults by gender") + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method='lm') + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x=ht, y=age), col="purple", se=FALSE, method='lm')
```

This is similar to [Simpsons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), 
where there are a number of additional examples of this situation including the 
[UC Berkeley gender bias lawsuit](http://vudlab.com/simpsons/).

Since gender affects the relationship between FEV and both height and age, the
appropriate model would then be:

$$ FEV1 \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*gender + \beta_{2}*height + \beta_{3}*age + \beta_{4}*gender*height + \beta_{5}*gender*age $$

If we let gender = 0 if the record is on a male, and gender = 1 if the record is
on a female, then the model for males would be:

$$ FEV1 \sim \beta_{0} +  \beta_{2}*height + \beta_{3}*age $$

and the model for females would be:

$$ FEV1 \sim (\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}) + (\beta_{2} + \beta_{4})*height + (\beta_{3}+\beta_{5})*age$$

Instead of running the model on the full set of data and then calculating
the correct coefficient for each gender we _stratify_ the model and run
a model with the same set of covariates on each strata (gender). 

$$ FEV1_{M} \sim \beta_{0M} +  \beta_{1M}*height + \beta_{2M}*age $$
$$ FEV1_{F} \sim \beta_{0M} +  \beta_{1F}*height + \beta_{2F}*age $$

The results of a model on FEV1 against age and height overall, and stratified
by gender can be found in Table 7.5 in the textbook. Notice there is an 
observable difference in all point and parameter estimates listed between
the overall model and the subsets. 

Even though the equations for males and females look quite similar, the 
predicted FEV1 for females of the same height and age as a male is expected 
to be less. We can confirm this ourselves. 

```{r}
# subset
M <- subset(fev2, gender=="M")
F <- subset(fev2, gender=="F")
# run stratified models
male_model   <- lm(FEV ~ age + ht, data=M)
female_model <- lm(FEV ~ age + ht, data=F)
# create new data frame using the overall mean height
new.data <- data.frame(ht = rep(66, 2), age=c(30, 50))
# predict on each model
predict(male_model, new.data)
predict(female_model, new.data)
```

### Testing equality of individual coefficients between groups
To compare the regression coefficients for men and women we could simply
compare the sign and magnitude of the standardized regression coefficients. 

If an interaction exists, then the two coefficients from the stratified models
would be equal. 

To test the null hypothesis of equal coefficients we compute the following
test statistic:

$$ Z = \frac{\beta_{M} - \beta_{F}}{\sqrt{SE^{2}(\beta_{M}) -SE^{2}(\beta_{F})}}$$

This $Z$ statistic has a normal distribution, and so you can use the 
`pnorm()` function to calculate the corresponding test statistic. As an example, 
to find the probability that |Z| > 1.96 you would type
```{r}
2*pnorm(-1.96)
```
Questions on the use of this function can be answered using the discussion forum. 

If you choose to do this using **R** to extract the regression values, you
can access the parameter estimates and their standard errors from the output
of the summary function. I.e.: `summary(male_model)$coefficients`. 


### Testing using a CI
You can also attempt to test for a difference in slope coefficients by
comparing the confidence intervals for the parameters. _Note: I am showing
how I wrangled the linear model output into a table that is easily read for
your info only. This is not mandatory but it looks nice._

```{r, results="asis"}
mci <- paste("(", round(confint(male_model)[,1],2),", ", round(confint(male_model)[,2],2), ")", sep="")
fci <- paste("(", round(confint(female_model)[,1],2),", ", round(confint(female_model)[,2],2), ")", sep="")
out <- cbind(Male = mci, Female = fci)[-1,]
rownames(out) <- c("Age", "Height")
out <- xtable(out)
print(out, type="html")
```

* If CIs _do not_ overlap then slopes are significantly different from each other.
* Since CIs do overlap, then two slopes _may or may not_ be significantly
  different from each other.

For both age and height the CI's for the slopes overlap a large amount, so I would suspect that 
there is no significant difference between the two models but the test statistic should be
calculated to confirm. 

# What to watch out for
[[top]](lec03_MultLinReg.html)

* See cautions for simple regression including violations of assumptions, outliers, 
  influential points
* Need representative sample
* Multicollinearity: coefficient of any one variable can vary widely, 
  depending on what others are included in the model
* Missing values: Even more important here
    - Default method is complete case analysis
    - If any variable in the model has missing data, the entire record is 
      excluded.
* Number of observations in sample should be large enough relative
  to the number of parameters that are being estimated.
  - This includes the variances and covariances of the parameter 
    estimates. 


##### On Your Own

1. Fit the regression model for the fathers using `FFVC` as the 
   dependent variable and age and height as the independent variables.
   Write the results for this regression model so they would be suitable
   for inclusion in a report. Include a table of results. 


2. Confirm that this F-test in the model results is the correct one to 
   use by manually calculating the F statistic using an ANOVA table. 
   Confirm the degrees of freedom in both the numerator and denominator 
   are correct, as well as the calculation of the p-value. If you are
   not familiar with the `qf()` function in R to find the probability 
   under the F distribution, here are some helpful resources in addition 
   to your classmates. 
    - http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/probability-distributions/f-distribution
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZiVe5DMJWA
  
  
3. Fit a regression model for females using `MFVC` as the dependent 
   variable and age and height as the independent variables. Summarize 
   the results in a tabular form. 
   
4. Test whether the effect of age and height on FVC for males are 
   significantly different than for females. 

5. Using the data on births from North Carolina (`NCbirths`), create a model
   of the weight of the baby at birth in pounds using the mothers age, 
   smoking habit, and the number of hospital visits during pregnancy as dependent
   variables. Interpret the regression coefficients in context of the problem 
   and include 95% confidence intervals and p-values in your discussion. 

6. Find a 95% prediction interval for a 30-year-old smoking mother with 16 visits 
   to the doctor during her pregnancy. 
   
7. Test for an interaction between smoking habit and the mothers age. 
   Include a plot similar to the one shown in the lecture notes to support 
   your findings. 


8. Using the Parental HIV data, generate a variable that represents the sum
   of the variables describing the neighborhood where the adolescent lives
   (`NGHB1-NGHB11`). Is the age at which adolescents start smoking different
   for girls compared to boys, after adjusting for the score describing the 
   neighborhood?
