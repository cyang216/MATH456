# Assigned Reading & additional references

Reading: Afifi Chapter 11. Skim the math, read the rest **carefully**. 
Skip/skim: 11.9-11.11

Algorithm specific information is interspersed throughout the lecture notes. 

* Lots of external reading/references
* Easy to go down the rabbit hole on this stuff! 
* Read/skim around to better understand these methods, but know that we could
  have spent easily an entire semester on machine learning algorithms. 
* This is just an introduction!
* Algorithms may take a while to computer, using `cache=TRUE` in the code chunk
  used to fit the model is advised.

# Introduction to Classifiers
We will be discussing the following 6 classifying algorithms. These are also
sometimes called _Machine Learning_ (ML) algorithms. They are simply methods to
build a model by learning from the relationships within the data. 

* Logistic Regression
* Linear Discriminant analysis 
* Naieve Bayes
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* k-nearest neighbors

For an idea of how many algorithms are out there: 

* Data Mining Map: http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm 
* http://topepo.github.io/caret/modelList.html 


Most ML algorithms will use, in some way, every variable that you give it access
to. To reduce model complexity and to reduce the chance of overfitting many models
apply a _penalty_ to the variable that diminishes their effect on the outcome, 
or reduces their chance of being included into the model. 

> Overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random error or noise 
> instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting generally occurs when a 
> model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to
> the number of observations.
(Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting)


### Machine learning in R: the `caret` package

We will be using the `caret` package in R to conduct all of our model building. 
Please read this small vignette for this package. 

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/vignettes/caret.pdf

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(caret)
```

Other packages you will need to install are: `pROC`, `caTools`, `bnclassify`,
`mda`, `party`, `rpart.plot`, `rattle`, `penalizedLDA`.  

* Typically don't need pre-install these 
* You're prompted to install them when you use an algorithm that needs them
* Once installed, they will automatically load as needed. 

If you want to use classifying algorithms other than the ones we have discussed
here, these references will be useful:

* http://topepo.github.io/caret/bytag.html
* http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/caret/html/train.html


### Cross-Validation
Many of these algorithms have _tuning parameters_ that have to be optimized. 
The most common way to choose the optimal value of a tuning parameter is
through _cross validation_ (CV). 

Recall that CV involves splitting the data (again) into testing and training
data sets, running a single model over a range of values for the tuning parameter, 
and finding the value of the tuning parameter that provides the best fit. 

We can specify how we want CV to occur in the `trainControl` function. 
Here we are specifying that we want to use repeated cross-validation. 
This means we apply k-fold CV (k defaults to 10 for this package) to one
split of the data. Then repeat this process 2 more times on different 
rando testing/training splits of the data. 
```{r}
ctrl <- trainControl(method="repeatedcv", repeats=3, 
                     classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)
```

The `classProbs=TRUE` argument tells the function to calculate the probabilities
of being in each class (depressed or not depressed), and to provide a summary
information specific to two classes (confusion matrix). 

### Fitting (Training) the model
The workhorse in the caret package is the `train()` function.
The generic syntax looks like the following: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
train(y ~ . ,
      data=, 
      method=, 
      preProc = c("center", "scale"), 
      metric = , 
      trControl = ctrl)
```

* `y~.` is the model syntax
* `data` is the data set used to train the model on
* `method` is the type of machine learning algorithm used
* `preProc` is the type of pre-processing that you want to be done
* `metric` is the performance metric that you want to optimize
* `trControl` is the type of training control you want to implement. 


Unless otherwise specified, this is the training control method that we will
use for all algorithms explored below. 

# Goal: Predict Depression
_Note: The data management code file for the depression data set has been updated. 
Go download it and update your analysis data file._
```{r}
depress <- read.delim("C:/GitHub/MATH456/data/depress_041616.txt")
```

## Pre-processing the data

Assigned Reading: http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-prepare-data-for-machine-learning/ 

Often ML algorithms perform better when the variables are also centered and scaled. 
This can be done at the time of calling the algorithm, so we won't do that manually here. 

### Recoding and ensuring variables have correct attributes
In the data management code I have already recoded variables, ensured that all
factor variables were being treated appropriately. This is also the step that 
you would conduct a PCA or create aggregate scales like CESD (which was already
created for us). 

However, specifically we need to ensure that R knows `cases` is a binary class
variable with positive outcome (class 1) of "Depressed". The way I handle this
is to first change `cases` to a factor variable, and swap the ordering of the 
levels. And then I apply named values to those levels. 
```{r}
depress$cases <- factor(depress$cases, levels=c(1,0))
levels(depress$cases) <- c("Depressed", "NotDepressed")
```

### Identifying missing data
```{r}
table(is.na(depress))
```
Two pieces of missing data. We have N=294, so will just delete those 2 records for now. 

```{r}
depress <- na.omit(depress)
```

### Looking at distributions and outliers
Ensure each variable has sufficient variation. 
```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(depress$age); hist(depress$income)
```

I then look at the categorical variables to see if there are any factor levels
(categories) with a small number of records in them. This can lead to unstable
estimates and algorithmic failure. 
```{r}
sapply(depress[,c('cases', 'marital', 'educat', 'employ', 'relig', 'health')], table)
```

There are very few records with education less than HS, employed "in school"
or "other". Specifically `In school` doesn't even have enough observations
to calculate a variance on. I will combine "In school" with "Other".

```{r}
library(car)
depress$employ <- recode(depress$employ, "'In School' = 'Other'")
table(depress$employ)
```

As I was building these lecture notes, I also came across problems with the
education variable (as expected). So I will further collapse categories for
this variable. 
```{r}
depress$educat <- recode(depress$educat, 
                        "c('<HS', 'Some HS', 'HS Grad') = 'HS';
                         c('Some college', 'BS') = 'UG';
                         c('MS', 'PhD') = 'GD'")
table(depress$educat)
```

Similarly I will look at the average value for all the 0/1 indicator variables in 
the data set to get an idea of the proportion of 1's. If any have a very low percent
of events (1's) in the data we will have to be mindful of how the algorithms are
performing with that variable in the model. 
```{r}
sapply(depress[,c('sex', 'drink', 'regdoc', 'treat', 'beddays', 'acuteill', 'chronill')], mean)
```

### Manual variable selection. 
Remove id, and the component variables `c1:c20` that are used to create `cesd`, 
_as well as_ the `cesd` variable since `cases` is a dichotomized version of this
variable. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE** At this point I have loaded some other package that has a 
`select` function. <span style="color:red">If you do not specify that here you want to specifically use
the select function from the `dplyr` package, this WILL NOT WORK. </span>
```{r}
depress <- depress %>% dplyr::select(-id, -c1:-c20, -cesd)
names(depress)
```
The remaining variables are ones that I want to keep as candidate variables
for a model. 

## Split the data into testing and training. 
Instead of randomly sampling the entire data set to create the testing
and training subsamples, the `createDataPartition` allows you to split
the testing and training samples while stratifying on the outcome. 
```{r}
set.seed(1067)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=depress$cases, p=.7, list=FALSE)
train <- depress[inTrain,];dim(train)
test  <- depress[-inTrain,];dim(test)
```

This is advantageous in that it ensures the relative proportion of the 
outcome variable is the same on both the testing and training data sets. 
```{r}
prop.table(table(depress$cases))
prop.table(table(train$cases))
prop.table(table(test$cases))
```

Now we are ready to build our models on the training data. 

# Use different classifying algorithms. 
## Logistic Regression
http://topepo.github.io/caret/Logistic_Regression.html

There are several different algorithms to perform a "flavor" of logistic 
regression analysis. We are going to use the `LogitBoost` algorithm. 

> Boosting methods have been originally proposed as ensemble methods,
> ... which rely on the principle of generating multiple predictions
> and majority voting (averaging) among the individual classifiers
> 
> Citation: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/buehlmann.pdf

```{r, cache=TRUE}
LogReg <- train(cases ~ . ,
                data=train, 
                method="LogitBoost", 
                preProc = c("center", "scale"), 
                metric = "ROC",
                trControl = ctrl)
```

Easy enough. Now let's look at the results of the model. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
LogReg
```

This output gives you a summary of the sample size going into the model, 
reminds you what the classes are, what pre-processing was done and what
training control / optimization methods were used. 

Then for each iteration the results show the sensitivity, specificity and
area under the ROC curve. 

We can also visualize how the AUC varied as a function of the number of
boosting iterations (a tuning parameter).
```{r}
plot(LogReg)
```

Almost all predictors available were used in the final model. 
```{r}
predictors(LogReg)
```

## Discriminant analysis

* Afifi Ch 11 introduces _Linear_ Discriminant analyses
* No distributional assumptions
* Finds a combination of features that separates two events
* Not all combinations are linear. http://topepo.github.io/caret/Discriminant_Analysis.html


### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Define $Z$ to be a linear combination of $X$'s: $Z = a_{1}X_{1} + a_{2}X_{2} +, \ldots , +a_{p}X_{p}$
* Select $a_{i}$'s to maximize the Mahalanobis distance between the average
  value of Z in group 1 from the average value of Z in group 2. 

Here I use two LDA algorithms: 
* `LDA.1` uses the basic Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm (`method =lda`)
   which does not contain any tuning parameters. 
* `LDA.2` includes a stepwise feature selection procedure (`method=stepLDA`)

The stepwise LDA procedure is _very_ verbose (it creates a lot of output)
so I specifically am NOT showing the results here. (I put ` ```{r, results='hide'} ` 
in the code chunk header).
```{r, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
LDA.1 <- train(cases ~ . ,
                data=train, 
                method="lda", 
                preProc = c("center", "scale"), 
                metric = "ROC",
                trControl = ctrl)
LDA.2 <- train(cases ~ . ,
                data=train, 
                method="stepLDA", 
                preProc = c("center", "scale"), 
                metric = "ROC",
                trControl = ctrl)
```

The results show that both have high sensitivity, low specificity,  with
AUC values between 0.5 and 0.7. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
LDA.1
LDA.2
```

The `finalModel` item within the model object contains information on the
prior probabilities of being depressed and the mean value for each variable 
within each of the depression categories. Specifically you can also output
the values for the $\beta$ regression coefficients. (_Not all methods
allow you to extract the values of the coefficients_)
```{r, results='asis'}
print(xtable(coef(LDA.1$finalModel), digits=2), type='latex')
```


* Every variable in the data set was used in this model. 
* Penalized models will _shrink_ these estimates down to zero for variables that
  do not contribute. 

Compare this to the LDA with a stepwise variable selection procedure added: 
```{r}
LDA.2$finalModel
```

This algorithm only chose gender as a predictor of depression. 

* LDA compared to PCA: http://www.r-bloggers.com/computing-and-visualizing-lda-in-r/


## Naieve Bayes
Bayesian probability models have the following form: 

$$ P(Y=1|X) \propto \pi(Y=1)P(X|Y=1) $$

In english, this says that the posterior probability of an event occuring
is proportional to the prior probability of the event occuring, times the
likelihood of the event occuring given the observed data. 

A naieve Bayes classifier can be thought of as fitting the joint probability
model to optmize the joint likelihood $p(Y, X)$ whereas logisic regression
optimizes the conditional probability $p(Y|X)$

The Naieve Bayes classifier...

* is easy and fast, performs well with multiple class (categorical) predictions. 
* Assumes the effect of $x_{1}$ on P(Y=1) is independent of the value of $x_{2}$. 
  (i.e. the X's are independent)
* Performs better than logistic regression with less training data if the 
  assumption of conditional independence is upheld


A list of Bayesian methods included in `caret` package. 
* http://topepo.github.io/caret/Bayesian_Model.html

```{r, cache=TRUE}
NB <- train(cases ~ . ,
                data=train, 
                method="nb", 
                preProc = c("center", "scale"), 
                metric = "ROC",
                trControl = ctrl)
```

This model takes slightly longer to fit compared to logistic regression, 
and at least in this example throws some warnings about zero probabilities

```{r, echo=FALSE}
NB
```

This plot shows you the change in AUC as a function of if the algorithm was
using a Gaussian or a non-parametric kernel. 
```{r}
plot(NB)
```

There is also a slightly different set of predictors chosen in the final model. 
```{r}
predictors(NB$finalModel)
```

## Decision Trees
Tree based methods are:

* Best when the relationship between the features and the response are complex
    - lot of non-linear terms and interactions. 
* Easy to explain & display graphically
* Mimics human decision making
* Tend to not have the same level of predictive accuracy as classical approaches. 
* Non-parametric
* Can overfit the data more easily than other methods. 


### General Algorithm/Process
1. Find the variable split that best separates the categories of the response variable
2. Divide the data into two subsets based on that split
3. Within each subset, find the next variable that best separates the data into two categories. 

The goal is to minimize the residual error. Technically trees can be built so tall that
each observation is perfectly predicted. This is called _over fitting_. This can be avoided
by _pruning_ trees back (simplifying the tree). 

* The level of pruning is a tuning parameter (`complexity`)
* Optimal complexity parameter can be determined by CV.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
DT <- train(cases ~ . ,
                data=train, 
                method="rpart", 
                metric = "ROC",
                trControl = ctrl)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DT
```

Visualize the decision tree. 
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
library(rpart.plot); library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(DT$finalModel, sub="")
```

_The progrma can't start because libatk-1.0.0.dll is missing from your computer. 
Try reinstalling the program to fix the problem._ Hit "OK" and install gTk2. 
You may have to restart R.

Tree based models also provide a measure on the importance of each candidate
variable. These can be visualized using a **Variable Importance Plot**.
```{r, fig.width=6}
plot(varImp(DT))
```

This echo's the decision tree plot in that top three primary variables important
in predicting depression is the number of days spent in bed, the level of 
general health, and employment status (specifically if they're unemployed)


## Random Forests
<span style="color:red">explain this model</span>

A random forest grows a large number of decision trees in order to improve
classification rate. 

http://trevorstephens.com/post/73770963794/titanic-getting-started-with-r-part-5-random

```{r, cache=TRUE}
RF <- train(cases ~ . ,
                data=train, 
                method="rf", 
                metric = "ROC",
                trControl = ctrl)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

                metric = "ROC",

# Compare algorithm performance
A resampling technique can be used to compare model performance. 
(Ref: _Hothorn at al, "The design and analysis of benchmark experiments-
Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (2005) vol 14 (3) pp 675-699)_)

```{r}
rValues <- resamples(list(logreg=LogReg,lda1=LDA.1, lda2=LDA.2, nb=NB, dt=DT, rf=RF, knn=kNN))
bwplot(rValues,metric="ROC")           
dotplot(rValues,metric="Sens")
# Hint: Look at rValues$metrics for other metrics you can visualize & compare.  
```

We can compare algorithms on their accuracy predicting the training
data set. Here I create a confusion matrix by using each model to predict
the class membership of data on the training data set. 
```{r}
acc.log <- confusionMatrix(predict(LogReg, train), train$cases, positive='Depressed')
acc.ld1 <- confusionMatrix(predict(LDA.1, train), train$cases, positive='Depressed')
acc.ld2 <- confusionMatrix(predict(LDA.2, train), train$cases, positive='Depressed')
acc.nb  <- confusionMatrix(predict(NB, train), train$cases, positive='Depressed')
acc.dt  <- confusionMatrix(predict(DT, train), train$cases, positive='Depressed')
acc.rf  <- confusionMatrix(predict(RF, train), train$cases, positive='Depressed')
acc.knn <- confusionMatrix(predict(kNN, train), train$cases, positive='Depressed')
```

Ok so how do extract the accuracy values? Lets see what data is in
the object created by the `confusionMatrix` function. 
```{r}
names(acc.log)
names(acc.log$overall)
names(acc.log$byClass)
```

Now that I've identified that the value for Accuracy is the first element
in the `$overall` list, I can extract these values and compare them in a 
tabular format. Furthermore the sensitivity, specificity and other table
values can be found in the `$byClass` list. 

For berivity sake (and to demonstrate some advanced R programming techniques)
I create a function `getmetrics` to extract only the values of the performance 
metrics I am interested in, then apply that function to all models in a list. 

```{r}
library(foreach)
model.list <- list(acc.log, acc.ld1, acc.ld2, acc.nb, acc.dt, acc.rf, acc.knn)
getmetrics <- function(x){
  y <- x[[1]]
  metrics <- c(y$overall[1], y$byClass[1:2])
  return(metrics)
  }

Metrics <- foreach(i = 1:length(model.list), .combine=rbind) %do% getmetrics(model.list[i])
rownames(Metrics) <- c("Boosted Logistic Regression", "LDA", "LDA w/stepwise",  
               "Naieve Bayes", "Decision Tree", "Random Forest", "k-Nearest neighbors")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
print(xtable(Metrics, digits=3), type='latex')
```

# Making predictions
On the hold-out testing data set. 


```{r, echo=1}
confusionMatrix(predict(RF, test), test$cases, positive='Depressed')
a <- round(confusionMatrix(predict(RF, test), test$cases, positive='Depressed')$overall, 3)
acc.ci <- paste(a[1], "(", a[3], " ," , a[4], ")", sep="")
```

The Random Forest model had an accuracy of `r acc.ci` on the testing data set.
