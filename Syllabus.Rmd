We will be using the statistical programming language R. You are expected to have prior experience with this language. 

Loaner laptops will be available for you to use during class time only. These systems will be set up properly and ready to go on day 1. You will eventually have to set up and bring your own laptop to class. There will not be sufficient time during class for you to complete the necessary work. All software programs we will use are free.

### Course Description

*Topics include*:


### Time Commitment
It is not easy to write literate computer programs but the payoff is immeasurable. You will spend 3 hours in class discussing topics and working on code. Expect to spend around 6 hours outside of class to read, write, code and problem solve. For the best chance of success start assignments early, use the discussion forms, form study groups and come to office hours. You will get out of this class what you put into it.

### Tentative Daily Schedule
The daily class schedule can be found [here](Schedule.html). This is an experimental course, so the list of topics and timings are subject to change. It is your responsibility to be aware of the current schedule. 



**Getting a head start on R**  
If you want to get a head start on learning R so we can get into the really kewl stuff, there are several ways to get started learning the basics right away. These topics will be covered in the first three weeks, most of the work you will be doing outside of class.
